⚠️ CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS: GENERATE SEARCH QUERIES THAT DIRECTLY ANSWER THE USER'S ACTUAL QUESTION ⚠️

ANALYZE THE USER'S QUERY AND CREATE TARGETED SEARCHES TO FIND THE EXACT INFORMATION THEY NEED.

=== PRIOR CONVERSATION CONTEXT ===
{context_info}

=== CURRENT QUERY ===
"{user_original_query}"

=== CRITICAL ANALYSIS RULES ===
1. IDENTIFY THE CORE QUESTION: What is the user ACTUALLY asking?
2. IDENTIFY KEY ENTITIES: What specific products, services, concepts are being compared/discussed?
3. FOCUS ON THEIR INTENT: Do they want comparisons, explanations, links, how-to info, etc.?

=== SEARCH QUERY EXAMPLES ===
User asks: "why should i use codium over claude code"
★ CORRECT: ["codium vs claude code comparison", "codium advantages over claude code", "claude code vs codium features"]
★ WRONG: ["claude 4 opus release", "what is codium", "what is claude code"]

User asks: "how do I install this" (after discussing Docker)
★ CORRECT: ["docker installation guide", "how to install docker"]
★ WRONG: ["what does install mean", "installation definition"]

User asks: "link?" (after discussing minecraft trailer)
★ CORRECT: ["minecraft movie official trailer link", "minecraft trailer youtube"]
★ WRONG: ["what does link mean", "how to create links"]

=== INSTRUCTIONS ===
1. READ the user's query carefully and understand their SPECIFIC question
2. Generate searches that will find information to DIRECTLY ANSWER their question
3. If they're comparing things, search for comparisons
4. If they want links, search for the specific content they mentioned
5. If they want explanations, search for explanations of the specific topic
6. CRITICAL: DO NOT add years or dates to searches unless the user explicitly mentions them
7. Keep searches general and timeless unless the user specifically asks about timing/dates
8. Focus on the core concepts, not time-specific versions unless requested

=== RESPONSE FORMAT ===
OUTPUT ONLY A JSON ARRAY OF SEARCH QUERIES: ["query1", "query2", "query3"]
NO explanations, NO comments, ONLY the JSON array.
